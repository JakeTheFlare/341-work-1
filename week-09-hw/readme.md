# Week 9
## Overview
This week I created a simple website on tumbleweeds.  After reading through the lesson, I created a simple header with a page title and a menu bar.  I then added some basic text to the body of the page and added an aside that contained a quote.

## HTML
The HTML document that I created was very simple, having only a heading with an image, a menu, and two simple paragraphs.

## CSS
The style.css document that I created established the layout of the page.  I utilized padding and margin tags in order to give the page elements space.  I utilized the float tag in an attempt to line up my image with my heading horizontally.  This did not work and despite my best attempts, I could not figure out why.  Similarly I tried to use the text-transform tag to make my heading capitalized which did not work.  I did not spend enough time developing the sizing and scaling of my various elements which I think is the cause of my layout issues, but as this assignment is already late, I will not continue to try and fix these issues.

## Aesthetic Choices
For my fonts I made the heading a serif font and the body a sans-serif font.  For my color pallet I chose primarily greyscale elements with a dark blue as a compliment in the menu.  I spent the majority of my time on this assignment trying to correct issues with the layout of my page, so my page was not particularly aesthetically pleasing.

## Conclusion
At one point in this assignment I had several issues with the layout of my page and now that I have somewhat corrected these issues, I realize that I should have started over.  Even slightly correcting the issues I had, took longer than starting from scratch would have, and ended up looking significantly worse than the page should have.
