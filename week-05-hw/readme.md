# Week 5 Work
## Overview
This week I went through all of the lessons on the website and learned the basics of images and forms.  I began by working on how to insert an image on a page.  Then I went through in the order that the forms were presented on the website, working on radio, then checkbox, etc. I then finished by learning how to create a submit button as well as labels for my forms.

## Images
The method for inserting images into a document was fairly simple.  I especially liked how intuitive it was to make an image act as a link.  I don't really have much to say about images, they were pretty easy to understand.

## Forms
I created a practice HTML document and as I read through the lesson I typed out most of the example forms, then, when working on the homework assignment, I attempted to work from memory, although I did have to reference my practice document and the website a few times.

## Questionnaire Assignment
I chose to use the questions from <u>Monty Python and The Holy Grail</u> during the Bridge of Death scene.  Luckily for me, each question could be logically presented through a unique type of form, so using five different forms was easy. I understand that these questions weren't exactly the style that would work for a questionnaire, but I figured that the point of the assignment was to learn the techniques to create a questionnaire rather than to create a useful questionnaire. The external site that I linked to actually did the math on the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow.
