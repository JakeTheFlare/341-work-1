# Week 8 Homework
### Overview
This week I created a page that featured the Flitcraft Parable from *The Maltese Falcon* by Dashell Hammet.  I utilized several different CSS elements that were covered in last week's lesson as well as this week's lesson.
### HTML
I created my index.html page and added all of the components without any styling.  This included my page title, my headings, and the paragraphs that made up the body of my text.  I then used some tags to create a link and created some italicized text.  After this I created my style.css page and linked it to my index.html.
### CSS
Within my style.css document, I created borders for my text, altered the background color, chose two specific fonts and their sizes, and altered the formatting of my text.  I also added a pseudo element in order to make the first letter of my paragraph a larger font, and bold.  I also attempted to use a pseudo class in order to create a hover effect on a link, but I was unable to make it function properly.  I also tried to make non-link text into a hover-element, which worked, but did not add to the page so I removed it.
