    <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="flex-item blue">
    <p>Responsive Web Design is an approach to web design that allows websites to be viewed on several different devices with different viewport sizes or device pixel ratios.  This is done by creating flexible elements that are able to change their properties by using media queries in order to know the characterstics of a device or window</p>

  <div class="flex-item white">
    <p>RWD is important for web developers, as without making good use of responsive design, websites could lose aesthetic quality and/or functionality when viewed on different devices or with different viewport sizes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="flex-item light-blue">
    <p>Flexbox allows designers to create elements within a site that can wrap on the page or change order, depending on the device or window size.  Because of this, flexbox is suitable for RWD as it is able to adjust the organization of a page based on the characteristics of the device that is viewing it.</p>

  <div class="flex-item grey">
    <p>Wireframes are a template for RWD that allow a designer to sketch a layout for different potential devices, such as mobile devices, tablets, or desktops.
