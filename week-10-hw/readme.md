# Week 10
## Site Planning
I began this week's assignment by completing a few wireframe sketches and deciding on a structure that I thought would work to convey my information.

## Page Layout
This page is meant to convey the benefits of responsive web design.  I have used a layout that attracts one's eye to the top of the page, and then flows downwards and/or left to right depending on the view port size.
