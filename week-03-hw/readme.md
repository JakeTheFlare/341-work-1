# My First Web Page
## Intro
After reading through the lesson on the github page I created a directory for this week's homework, and an html document within that.  

## HTML in Atom

I then opened the html document within atom and utilized the basic structure elements from the lesson to put together a rough layout, establishing:
- doctype
- character set
- the page title

I then added the content that I was instructed to add, then opened the file in Google Chrome.

## Going Live

I navigated to the Settings tab within github, and changed the source to master branch.  After this I realized that I had not committed the changes that I had made within my repo, so I committed the changes, synced up with the github repository, and pushed my data to the github repository.

## Final Thoughts

After making sure that my webpage was live, I added a haiku that I found online and added the appropriate headings and line breaks. I then went through the process of syncing and pushing my data to the github repository.
