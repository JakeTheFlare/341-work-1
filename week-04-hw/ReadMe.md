# Week 4 Homework

## Recipe Page

This week I created a new page that contained a recipe.  Within this page I created an unordered list for the ingredients, and an ordered list for the directions.

 After this I created a definitions list on a new page. I then created a link from my recipe page to this definitions page, and vice versa.  I then finished the recipe page by adding an email link to my university email account.

## Wayback Machine

 I utilized the Wayback Machine in order to examine The Atlantic's website and Stanford's website. For each website I looked at the earliest available iteration and then advanced forward through time.  With this process I observed many changes improving each site aesthetically and functionally.  I also looked at various iterations of the code of each website, seeing the ever increasing complexity. I have included links to screenshots that I took of the different stages of these sites.
