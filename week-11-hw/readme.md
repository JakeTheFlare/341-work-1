# Week 11 HW
## Overview
For this week's assignment I worked through the lesson and learned how to use images for backgrounds, and how to create a parallax effect when scrolling down a page.  I also learned how to utilize viewport units and how to effectively use a hero image on a page.

## Background Images
For this week's assignment I utilized three photos that I have taken - one from Florida and two from Hawaii.  I used the background-repeat, background-position, background-attachment, and background-size elements in order to effectively place my images and to make them aesthetically pleasing when scrolling.

## Content
For this assignment I made very simple content, as the focus of the assignment was on the background images and the parallax scrolling.  I created various containers that all followed a simple color scheme and utilized simple elements in order to maintain a somewhat uniform appearance.

## Conclusions
The background-image element is intuitive to use and adds a lot to the visual aspect of a web page.  When accompanied by a smooth parallax effect, this simple change adds a lot of aesthetic value and depth to a page, when compared to a simple color for a background.  Overall I found this fairly easy and very useful.
